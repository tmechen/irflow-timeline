## Export Workflow Example

A typical investigation export workflow:

1. **Analyze** — use search, filters, and analytics to investigate
2. **Bookmark** — star important rows as you find them
3. **Tag** — categorize findings (Suspicious, Lateral Movement, etc.)
4. **Generate Report** — create the HTML summary
5. **Export Data** — export filtered CSV/XLSX for further analysis or archival
6. **Share** — send the report to your team or include in your case file
