  - Eliminates re-rendering of 8,000+ SVG rect elements on every mouse move

- **Multi-file EVTX import stability** — Fixed crashes when importing 15+ EVTX files
  - Global EVTX message provider cache (created once, reused across all imports)
  - GC pause between sequential imports to prevent memory accumulation
  - Deferred index/FTS builds until import queue fully drains
  - Explicit EvtxFile handle cleanup and large array nulling after parse

  - `getEmptyColumns` combined per-column queries into single combined query
  - COLLATE NOCASE indexes for proper sort alignment
  - `extract_date` / `extract_datetime_minute` charCodeAt fast path (~2x faster than regex)
  - REGEXP function caching (avoids recompilation for same pattern)
  - BFS queue optimization (index-based O(1) replaces shift-based O(n))

- **Render optimization** — Faster cell rendering and column lookups
  - Set-based visible column lookups replacing O(n) Array.includes()
  - Memoized combined highlight regex (IOC + search) avoids per-cell regex creation
  - Process tree detection map cached per data reference

### UI Improvements

- **Welcome screen** — Larger, more prominent welcome card
- **Context menu** — macOS-style glass/blur aesthetic with inline SVG icons
- **Process tree row hover** — Subtle highlight via CSS (added to index.html)

### Robustness

- **Buffered debug logging** — Log writes batched (50 entries / 2s flush) across main.js, db.js, parser.js
- **Memory logging** — Heap and RSS usage logged after each EVTX parse for diagnostics
- **Import queue safety** — Index and FTS builds deferred until all queued imports complete
- **Safer filename decoding** — try/catch on decodeURIComponent prevents crash on malformed URIs
- **React Error Boundary** — Graceful UI crash recovery with "Try to Recover" button

## v1.0.0-beta

### New Features

- **Persistence Analyzer** — Automated detection of 30+ persistence techniques with risk scoring
  - Supports EVTX event logs and registry exports (auto-detect mode)
  - 18 EVTX detection rules: Services (7045/4697), Scheduled Tasks (4698/4699/106/141/118/119), WMI subscriptions (5861, Sysmon 19/20/21), Registry autorun (Sysmon 12/13/14), Startup folder drops (Sysmon 11), DLL hijacking (Sysmon 7), Driver loading (Sysmon 6), ADS (Sysmon 15), Process tampering (Sysmon 25), Timestomping (Sysmon 2)
  - 15 registry persistence locations: Run/RunOnce, Services, Winlogon, AppInit_DLLs, IFEO, COM hijacking, Shell extensions, Boot Execute, BHO, LSA packages, Print Monitors, Active Setup, Startup folders, Scheduled Tasks, Network Providers
  - Risk scoring (0-10) based on technique severity, suspicious paths, command-line indicators, and encoding detection
  - Custom Rules Editor — toggle default rules on/off, add custom EVTX/Registry rules from GUI
  - Suspicious detection engine: non-Microsoft tasks, GUID-named tasks, LOLBin execution, user-writable paths, anti-forensics task deletion
  - Three view modes: Grouped, Timeline, Table
  - Cross-event correlation (links task creation to executables, WMI filter-consumer-binding)
  - Bulk tagging and filtering from results
  - Respects all active timeline filters

- **Legacy .xls support** — Binary OLE2/BIFF format files parsed via SheetJS
  - Complements existing XLSX streaming reader
  - Handles date formatting and cell type conversion

  - Generic/suspicious names (`ADMIN`, `TEST`, `HACKER`, etc.)
  - Non-ASCII hostnames
  - Highlighted with red pulse in graph

- **React Error Boundary** — Graceful UI crash recovery with "Try to Recover" button

### Performance

- **Import speed** — Significantly faster bulk loading
  - `journal_mode=OFF` during import (temp DB, crash = re-import)
  - 1GB SQLite cache (was 500MB), 64KB page size (was 32KB)
  - 128MB read chunks for CSV (was 16MB)
  - Adaptive batch sizes up to 100,000 rows (was fixed 50,000)
  - Pre-allocated parameter arrays reused across all batches
  - Full SQLite parameter capacity for multi-row INSERT (removed artificial 1000-row cap)
  - Time-based progress reporting every 200ms (was row-count-based)

- **Background indexing** — Column indexes and FTS build after import without blocking UI
  - All columns indexed (not just timestamps), one at a time with event loop yields
  - Sequential index → FTS pipeline to avoid SQLite page cache thrashing
  - Phase-specific SQLite pragmas: 1GB cache + 8 threads during builds, 256MB cache + 512MB mmap during queries
  - ANALYZE runs after index build for query optimizer stats
  - Status bar shows combined column index + FTS build progress

- **Excel serial date support** — Numeric serial dates (e.g., `45566` → `2024-10-05`) recognized in histogram and timeline functions

### Robustness

- **Debug logging** — Shared `dbg()` logger across main.js, db.js, parser.js writing to `~/tle-debug.log`
- **Safe IPC wrappers** — All IPC handlers wrapped with try/catch + debug logging via `safeHandle()`, all sends check window existence via `safeSend()`
- **Crash guards** — `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection` handlers with user-facing error dialog
- **Failed import cleanup** — Partially-imported tabs cleaned up on error
- **Build safety** — `_isBuilding()` guard protects bookmark/tag writes during background index builds

### UI Improvements

- **Scroll performance** — `requestAnimationFrame`-throttled scroll handler
- **Per-tab scroll state** — Scroll position, selection, and last-clicked row preserved when switching tabs
- **Window resize tracking** — Viewport height adapts to window resize/zoom
- **Progress bar animation** — CSS `transform: scaleX()` for smoother progress rendering
- **Indexing status indicator** — Toolbar shows column index + FTS build progress with phase labels
