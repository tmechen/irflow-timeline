# Quick Start

Get up and running with your first timeline analysis in under a minute.

## Open a File

There are three ways to open a file:

1. **Menu:** File > Open (`Cmd+O`)
2. **Drag and drop:** Drag a file onto the application window
3. **Double-click:** Double-click a supported file in Finder

IRFlow Timeline will automatically detect the file format and begin streaming the import.

## Import Progress

During import you will see:

- A progress bar showing rows imported
- Automatic delimiter detection for CSV/TSV files
- Sheet selection dialog for multi-sheet Excel files
- Column discovery for EVTX files

::: info Large Files
Files over 1GB may take a minute to import. The streaming architecture processes data in 128MB chunks with adaptive batch sizes (up to 100,000 rows per batch), so the UI remains responsive throughout. After import, column indexes and full-text search indexes build in the background — you can start working immediately.

## Navigate the Grid

Once imported, your data appears in a virtual-scrolling grid:

- **Scroll** through millions of rows smoothly — only ~5,000 rows are loaded at a time
- **Sort** by clicking any column header (click again to toggle ASC/DESC)
- **Resize columns** by dragging the column header borders
- **Pin columns** by `Cmd+Click` on a header and selecting Pin Left
- **Select rows** by clicking; hold `Shift` for range selection

## Search Your Data

Use the search bar at the top (`Cmd+F`):

1. Type your search term
2. Select a search mode from the dropdown:
   - **Mixed** — Combines full-text and substring search (default)
   - **FTS** — Full-text search (word-level matching)
   - **LIKE** — Substring match
   - **Fuzzy** — Tolerates typos
   - **Regex** — Regular expression patterns

Results update as you type (debounced at 500ms).

## Filter by Column

Click the filter icon on any column header to:

- **Text filter:** Type to match values in that column
- **Checkbox filter:** Select/deselect specific unique values
- **Date range:** For timestamp columns, pick a start and end date

## Bookmark Important Rows

Click the star icon on any row to bookmark it. Bookmarked rows are preserved across sessions and included in exported reports.

Toggle `Cmd+B` to show only bookmarked rows.

## Add Tags

`Cmd+Click` a row and select **Add Tag** to annotate it. Tags are color-coded and can be used for filtering and reporting. Common tags include:

- Suspicious
- Lateral Movement
- Exfiltration
- Persistence
- C2

## View the Histogram

Click the **histogram toggle** button in the toolbar to open the timeline visualization:

- See event distribution across days, hours, or minutes
- Click and drag to brush-select a time range — the grid filters automatically
- Color-coded by artifact source when using merged timelines

## Next Steps

- Learn about all [search modes and filters](/features/search-filtering)
- Set up [color rules](/features/color-rules) for visual pattern matching
- Explore the [Process Inspector](/features/process-tree) for Sysmon analysis
- Track lateral movement with the [Lateral Movement Tracker](/features/lateral-movement)
- Configure [KAPE integration](/workflows/kape-integration) for auto-detection
